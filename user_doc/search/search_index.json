It features a graphical user interface for efficiently setting up estimating and forecasting options for the model you choose. This documentation describes how to install and use the platform, and explains the output generated by the platform in details. It also provides instructions on how to incorporate your own DSGE models into the platform , and how to compare the forecasting outcomes across various models. If you have any questions, please send us an email at ???@???.com Major advantages Rich models to estimate The platform can generate forecasting results based on a wide range of estimated DSGE models and time-series models. It currently includes four small scale new-Keynesian models (Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997; Bernanke et al., 1999; Del Negro and Schorfheide, 2004; Wieland and Wolters, 2011) and two medium-scale new-Keynesian models (Smets and Wouters, 2007; Del Negro et al., 2015). It also offers two Bayesian VAR models with the Minnesota priors (Doan et al., 1984; Litterman, 1986) and the GLP priors (Giannone et al., 2015). Rich data to choose The platform already includes the a rich set of macroeconomic data for estimation, which not only saves you the time for manually collecting data, it can also guarantee that the difference in models forecasts will never come from the difference in data collection and processing procedures. There are currently eight observables for you to choose from: Real output growth Consumption growth Investment growth Real wage growth Hours worked Inflation measured by the GDP deflator Federal Funds Rate Credit spread These data ranges from 1960:Q1 to 2017:Q4, and it includes both real time data and revised data for different time vintages. Moreover, one could even augment the data by including the nowcast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters of the observables when estimating a model. Rich options to specify There are numerous of options to specify in model estimation and forecasts generation. The DSGE model can be estimated via either mode estimation or Metropolis-Hasting estimation techniques. You also have the freedom to decide data spans in different ways: by selecting the expanding series option, one simply needs to specify the date of the first observation, while by selecting the rolling window option, one simply needs to specify the length of the data. Rich results to analyze The platform will produce model forecasts based on the specific model and options you choose, and it will compare this result with forecasts generated by other models and options for respective vintages. In addition, it can also plot and compare impulse response functions based on the Bayesian IRF, as well as historical variance decompositions across various models. User-friendly graphical interface The graphical interface makes the above choices fast, simple and clear.

To include your own DSGE model into the forecast platform, you have multiple options. If you merely wish to include your forecast into the forecast chart for comparison purpose, please consider only add the model forecast but not the model into the Platform. The details of adding model forecasts are described here . If otherwise you wish to take the full advantage of the Platform, you may follow the steps below. As of now, only DSGE models written as Dynare mod-file can be added, and only models estimated based on (the complete set or a subset of) the eight observables listed in the introduction can be included in the Platform. The Dynare names of these eight observables are in the Excel spreadsheet List_Observables_US.xls in the EstimationInterface folder. Please make sure that in your mod-file you have established some relationships between the observables in your model with these eight observables. Please make sure the following steps are strictly followed to include your model in the Platform: Step 1: Copy your mod-file Create a subfolder in the MODEL folder to store your model. Make sure that all letters in the name of this subfolder are capitalized (e.g., DSGE_TEST ). Copy your mod-file and necessary functions (e.g., the m-file for computing the steady state) into this subfolder, and make sure that the mod-file has the same name as the folder name (e.g., DSGE_TEST.mod ). Comment out any estimation commands in the mod-file. Declare the eight observables as varobs in your mod-file and link these observables to your own observation equations. Step 2: Edit EstimationInterface.m Find the m-file EstimationInterface.m that is stored in the EstimationInterface folder, and open it up in the Matlab editer. Add your model to the model handle list as other models in Line 53-55 in basics.modelslist . This will link the graphical user interface to your model folder and mod-file. Add the name of the model into the list of model names as other models in Line 57-62 in basics.models . This will help Matlab recognize your model. Declare the region of your model as other models in Line 64-65 in basics.region : 1 for US model, and 2 for Euro-Area models Note For now only US data is available, so please to declare your model region as 1 Add an indicator vector in the matrix basics.model_observables that links observables to your model: for each observables, input 1 if it is used in your mod-file and input 0 if not. This vector shall be added in Line 80-85 in the m-file. Save and close this m-file. Step 3: Edit EstimationInterface.fig Open up the graphical interface EstimationInterface.fig in the Matlab GUIDE editor, which is also in the EstimationInterface folder. Copy one of the model checkboxes from the MODELS block and paste it inside this block. Open the properties of your checkbox, and change the tag property to match the handle name you gave in the basics.modelslist . Change the string property of your checkbox to the name of your model.

To run this file, you can either open the \ufb01le in Matlab editor and click the Run button, or you can navigate the current directory to the path for the platform folder, and type ForecastPlatform in the Matlab command window and press the Enter button. After running the m-file, a graphical user interface of the platform will appear. Before running the platform, please clean the workplace using the Matlab command clear all , otherwise an unexpected error could be raised during the execution of the program. Note To make sure that all the relevant options will be correctly set up, it is instrumental to follow top-down and left-right fashion in the selection of options in the platform. Step 1: Selecting a model in the Models block The block on the top left corner shows the models to estimate. There are three estimable DSGE models for the US economy started with \u2018US\u2019, and two Bayesian-VAR models started with \u2018BVAR\u2019, for you to choose. Only one model can be chosen in one run. Step 2: Specifying estimation options in the Estimation Methods block By choosing a DSGE model, further options in the lower left block will become available, in which you can choose an estimation method and specify hyper-parameters for the method you choose. Click on the first option to obtain mode estimation, and the settings submenu will grey out by default. Click on the second option to obtain Metropolis-Hastings (MH) estimation, and the submenu will be activated. In the submenu, you can change the length and number of the Markov chains, the percentage of burn-in samples, and the scale for acceptance rate for the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. By choosing the BVAR-Minnesota prior model, you have the opportunity to further specify hyper-parameters by inside the box Minnesota prior parameters at the end the of Models option. By choosing the BVAR-GLP prior model, the hyper-parameters can no longer be adjusted because they are already optimally chosen by the algorithm. The Estimation Methods block will remain grey out in the last two cases. Step 3: Choosing the data in the Data block Having selected the model, the data must be chosen in the upper right Data block, in which you can change the vintage span, the data type, the estimation type and corresponding sample settings. Vintage Span . This submenu sets the time span for the chosen vintages. If only one vintage is chosen, the platform will then estimate the model for that vintage only. If multiple vintages are chosen, the platform will then estimate the model multiple times, one for each vintage selected. By default the only vintage selected is the fourth quarter of the year 2007. To run the estimation for the most recent vintage, please select 2017Q4, for both fields. Data Type . This submenu features to two options. By choosing Real-Time , the estimation will be based on data available at the time when the data is generated. By choosing Revised , the platform will use the most recent revised data in the estimation. Estimation Type . This submenu includes two options: Choosing Expanding Series will create you a data set, that starts at the first observation in the Sample Settings menu. Thus, by choosing this option, please also specify the starting point of the data in the First Obs in the submenu below. By default the first observation will be the first quarter of year 1960. Choosing Rolling Windows will result in fixed length samples, relative to the estimation vintage. By choosing this option, please also specify the window length in the Rolling Window Length (Quarters) in the submenu below. By default the length of the rolling window will be set at 80 quarters, or equivalently, 20 years. Note Due to data limitations, some vintages might be incomplete. To find a report on this, please consult in the Excel spreadsheet in the estimation interface folder. Sample Settings . In this last submenu, you can additionally choose the option Augment Data with SPF nowcast , which enables you adding the current vintage of the SPF nowcast in the data. Choosing including SPF nowcast will extend the data on some observables for which SPF nowcast were available. The nowcast of other observables will generated automatically by Dynare. Note If you choose not to include SPF nowcast, the first forecast generated by the platform will be the nowcast. Step 4: Generating desired outcomes in the Forecasts & Performances block The last block on the lower right enables you to select further options for on the outcomes you wish to generate. The length of the out-of-sample forecasts can be specified in the Forecast Horizon . The first forecast will be the nowcast, unless you conditioned the nowcast on the SPF projections. By default, each model forecasts up to four quarters, that is five horizons ahead. Clicking on Plot Forecasts , you can select for which vintages the comparisons of the forecast should be plotted. The submenu Forecast Chart - Vintages enables you to select a subset of estimated forecasts to be plotted. Under the submenu Plot Options , you can choose whether to include the SPF projections, choose which forecasts to plot (mean or mode), and choose which forecast density to be included in the chart (only one can be chosen).

In the submenu, you can change the length and number of the Markov chains, the percentage of burn-in samples, and the scale for acceptance rate for the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. By choosing the BVAR-Minnesota prior model, you have the opportunity to further specify hyper-parameters by inside the box Minnesota prior parameters at the end the of Models option. By choosing the BVAR-GLP prior model, the hyper-parameters can no longer be adjusted because they are already optimally chosen by the algorithm.

Vintage Span . This submenu sets the time span for the chosen vintages. If only one vintage is chosen, the platform will then estimate the model for that vintage only. If multiple vintages are chosen, the platform will then estimate the model multiple times, one for each vintage selected. By default the only vintage selected is the fourth quarter of the year 2007. To run the estimation for the most recent vintage, please select 2017Q4, for both fields. Data Type . This submenu features to two options. By choosing Real-Time , the estimation will be based on data available at the time when the data is generated. By choosing Revised , the platform will use the most recent revised data in the estimation. Estimation Type . This submenu includes two options: Choosing Expanding Series will create you a data set, that starts at the first observation in the Sample Settings menu. Thus, by choosing this option, please also specify the starting point of the data in the First Obs in the submenu below. By default the first observation will be the first quarter of year 1960. Choosing Rolling Windows will result in fixed length samples, relative to the estimation vintage. By choosing this option, please also specify the window length in the Rolling Window Length (Quarters) in the submenu below. By default the length of the rolling window will be set at 80 quarters, or equivalently, 20 years. Note Due to data limitations, some vintages might be incomplete. To find a report on this, please consult in the Excel spreadsheet in the estimation interface folder. Sample Settings . In this last submenu, you can additionally choose the option Augment Data with SPF nowcast , which enables you adding the current vintage of the SPF nowcast in the data. Choosing including SPF nowcast will extend the data on some observables for which SPF nowcast were available. The nowcast of other observables will generated automatically by Dynare.
