## Welcome to the Macroeconomic Forecasting Platform

This platform is built with Matlab (Dynare) for estimating and comparing the forecasting performance of advanced DSGE and Bayesian VAR models.

The platform is still in developing. Please visit [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/forecastingplatform/forecastingplatform) to download the latest version of the platform. Please make sure that you have Matlab version 2017a (or higher) and Dynare version 4.3.3 (or higher) to run the platform.

The user documentation can be found here.
